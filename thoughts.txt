Time based version control: 

    Nodes are defined by edges and properties
    Whenever an edge changes store the change (timestamp+newvalue)
        This needs to be in sorted order to allow log n lookup of edges of relevant time stamp
            linkedlist?
    Whenever a property store the change (timestamp/value)
    A node exists at a timestamp if it has any properties/ingoing/outgoing edges at that time.
        Properties stored in sorted order by property
        
    Store in logn sorted order
       
    Traversing
        Get type Y edges of node Z 
        At latest timestamp - can see all properties/edges ever - have head to sorted order so O(1) per property/edge
        
        In Past
            Just log(n) to the appropriate property/edge per node...
